Safe exiting, writing to file/database won't be interrupted by SIGTERM
Config option 'pidfile' to select file where to write pid
Config option 'output_database' to select database type
Updated legend and converted it to PNG
Netmask is now correctly displayed in syslog
Coding style changes (should be now more readable)
Support for building without libgd (no static graphs then, only database and cdf logging)
MySQL support
Make file tweaks
Adhere more strictly to GNU coding standards for directories
Optional htdocs and log file locations specified at configure time
Optional bandwidthd.conf entries to specify htdocs and log file locations
Command line option help
Command line option for specifying a bandwidthd.conf file
Changed signal handling to avoid the parent thread dying from a hup during 
	CDF recovery
Fixed bug that could cause segfault if no devices exist that can be captured
	from and no device is specified in the bandwidthd.conf
Fixed bug in CDF recovery that may have been affecting recovery on FreeBSD systems.

2.0.1 
Big Feature - Added optional postgresql database logging mode and php for dynamic graph creation from 
	databases.  Great for big sites,  multiple sensors with very low overhead collect traffic statistics
	and log them to database.  Graphs are created when a user visits the page instead of burning CPU
	cycles night and day.  Logging/Multiple sensor support is completed.  
Big Feature - Implemented auto conf
	Ported to and compiles on:
	ix86 Fedora Core 2
	ix86 Solaris 9
	ix86 OpenBSD 3.4
	ix86 Debian 2.2
	ix86 FreeBSD 4.8
	AMD64 Fedora Core 3
	PPC MaxOsX 10.2
	ix86 Microsoft Windows
Changed default interval to 200 seconds to save ram and cpu power
Huge performance gain in graphing engine due to bug fix (Peak Send and Total Sent strings font
	operations were being done to each graphic almost 1000 times instead of just 1)
Removed need of Sys V IPC shared memeory
log rotation on all logs implemented - secondary logs rotate every RANGE?/RANGE1 HUP's
Added syslog support, removed all printf's except a few early errors, closed 
	stdin, stdout, and stderr before beginning capture loop
Bandwidthd collects the pids of it's children and distributes HUP and TERM signals when issued
	to the first process
Changed yy parser name to bdconfig_ to avoid a bug in BSD
Added some semi-colons to conf.y to fix BSD flex/bison compatability bug
Fixed bug that caused memory corruption when ram datastore had data on more than IP_NUM ips.
Fixed some longs that missed being converted to unsigned long long.
Fixed bug in CDF recovery that would cause bandwidthd to ignore some CDF logs during recovery
Bandwidthd now checks for ./etc/bandwidthd.conf, and if it doesn't exist it checks for 
	/usr/local/bandwidthd/etc/bandwidthd.conf, if that exists it will chdir("/usr/local/bandwidthd")
Fixed problem that caused bandwidthd to sit and never create graphs
if graph is set to false do not store data in ram, do not fork unless output_cdf is true
log names changed to be consistent so all logs could be rotated with same function

1.2.1b
Reduced Loading spam
Added filter option to bandwidhtd.conf to specify libpcap filter
Fixed problems with YAxis labeling and scaling on high volume networks
Skips starting a new graphing run if the last run is still going to prevent
	fork bomb style box crashes
Exits on a configuration error
Print out line number of errors in bandwidthd.conf
Caused graph_cutoff to be scaled with time range to reduce load induced by
	weekly/monthly/yearly graphs
Fixed bad documentation

1.2.0
10,000 downloads edition! :)
Added Weekly, Monthly, and yearly graphs!
Bandwidthd will now do a graph run immediatly after loading it's data
New 10 Minute (log2.cdf), 1 hour (log3.cdf), and 12 hour (log4.cdf) interval log files
Graphing code now scales better with different custom intervals and periods

1.1.8b
Fixed bug in support for linux cooked socket DLT_LINUX_SLL (PPPOE, T1, etc) - Christian Laubscher

1.1.8
Wrapped DLT_EN10MB in an ifdef for platforms that don't supply it
Fixed bandwidthd crashing when brought up on an ip addressless interface
Fixed segfault in DropOldData discovered by Hannes Reich
Fixed some errors in Makefile, preserved bandwidthd.conf - Bob Toxen
Detected https as http - Bob Toxen
Fixed bug that would cause "killall -HUP bandwidthd" to kill the graphing process
Initial support for datalink type 12 DLT_RAW 
Initial support for datalink type 6 token ring DLT_IEEE802

1.1.7
Compiles clean on BSD - Colin Harford - Sheepkiller

1.1.6
Updated Documentation
Fixed Segmentation fault in DropOldData, also pointed out by Hannes Reich
Modified RecoverCdf to load files from the rotation
Added log rotation
Modifed RecoverCdf to load large log files much faster
Added code by Hannes Reich which loads the contents of the log file back into
bandwidthd on restart, so data is persistant between restarts.
Alan Evens replaced my bugged sort algorithm with one of his own, fixing the
long standing sort issue.

1.1.5
Fixed DLT_LINUX_SLL undefined compile bug by wrapping it in an #ifdef
Added date/time to top of html output
Added ftp track based on "ftp-data" port numbers
Added alternating light blue background to stats table and centered 
column headers
Modified stat table so everything lines up and it's easy to read at 
low res - Alan Evens

1.1.4
added totals graph
Added support for linux cooked sockets, allowing the monitoring of many
ppp interfaces and T1's.
csv logging made much more usefull, now actually logs the throughput for each
interval, not the total acumulated so far.
check for ./htdocs and ./etc/bandwidthd.conf so new people don't get confused
when they don't run bandwidthd from it's directory.
reap zombies every interval, just not when we don't skip.
updated documentation

1.1.3
Makefile was broken, bandwidthd could only compile under solaris

1.1.2
Added new logo
Increased sample size to 100 bytes in order to avoid future bugs resulting 
from trying to categorise by information in the tcp header when ip options
are present.
Source now compiles and works under Solaris with gcc :) 

1.1.1
Fixed a bug that caused web and p2p counters not to increment when ip options
are present in the packets.
Was only capturing 34 bytes of packets instead of 54, http and p2p weren't 
being incremented because the tcp header was not captured.  Older versions
of libpcap must have returned full headers regardless of pcap size.

1.1.0
Added a logo.gif to the package
Added "skip_intervals" option to the config file  
Added "graph_cutoff" option to the config file
Added "promiscuous" option to the config file (Allows graphing of traffic not routed through the host)
Changed default to promiscuous
Added "output_cdf" option to the config file (Logs bandwidthd data to comma deliminated file)
Added "graph" option to the config file (Set to false to suppress drawing of the graphs)
When IpCount (Number of ip's being tracked) exceed IP_NUM (Max number of IP's) stop tracking new ip's instead of exiting
Added legend to graphs
Added CHANGELOG
Updated Documentation
Added credits to bottom of top20 web page

1.0.0
Changed all statistics storage to type "long long" to avoid roll over
Updated documentation
Added "make dist-clean" to force rebuild of flex and bison output
Modifed make file to allow building without flex and bison
Removed some debugging macros that wouldn't compile under old versions of gcc
Modifed RDNS code to complain less and use longjump less

0.46
