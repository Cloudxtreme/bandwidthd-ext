Move output modules to forked section
Config switches for sample intervals and graphing ranges

# Features requested by people, I make a note of them here in case myself
# or someone else wants to come along and implement them.
Stoilis:
List of IP's to exclude from the page
Switch to hide all ip addresses

Me:
Switch to only graph traffic not to and from the local network (internet
	traffic only)

Change ram datastore:  Linked lists with identifiers that store only non-zero traffic, use
	longs for traffic storage instead of long longs and implement a multiplyer field.
	will allow implementation of custom ports to graph and reduce ram usage by 70%ish
